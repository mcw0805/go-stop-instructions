                <h6 class="card-subtitle">Why "Go-Stop"?</h6>

                <p>
                    When the player earns at least the minimum points needed to win the game, the player may call “Go” to continue playing to increase their points and hence increase their money or “Stop” to end the game and the winning player collects their winnings.
                </p> 

                <p>
                    Calling “Go” is a way to increase the winnings at exponential levels (double, quadruple, octuple, etc.), but it can be risky because the opponent(s) are given the opportunity to score the minimum points and collect the winnings.
                </p> 

                <p>
                    The “Go” part makes the game thrilling as it can transfer large sums of winnings among the players in each game. However, it may perhaps leave the losing players in despair.
