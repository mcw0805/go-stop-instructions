                        <p>
                            When the player earns at least the minimum points needed to win the game, the player may call “Go” to continue playing to increase their points and hence increase their money OR “Stop” to end the game and collect the winnings.
                        </p> 
        
                        <p>
                            Calling “Go” is a way to increase the winnings at exponential levels (double, quadruple, octuple, etc.), but it can be risky because the opponent(s) are given the opportunity to score the minimum points and collect the winnings.
                        </p> 
        
                        <p>
                            The “Go” part makes the game thrilling as it can transfer large sums of winnings among the players in each game. However, it may perhaps leave the losing players in despair.

                            Go-Stop can played as a light form of gambling. Although the game can be played without money, it is considered to be more stimulating and entertaining with the gambling aspect. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            The players can decide to map each point earned to a specified amount of money. The more money allocated per point, the more risk the players have to make when they make each decision.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            It is highly recommended that the game be played within family and friend circles. The gambling aspect—much like with any other common gambling casino games—can instigate distrust with cheating and bring legal troubles. With underaged players, it is recommended that the game is played with adult supervision or that gambling aspect is taken out.
