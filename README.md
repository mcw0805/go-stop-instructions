# GO-STOP INSTRUCTIONS

This is a static website that shows you how to play the Korean card game, Go-Stop.

I made this for my LMC 3403 Technical Communications project at Georgia Tech. I will keep trying to update for
optimizations and errors.

Please note that the figures are made using hwatu .ai files created by Tommy in Urban brush:

The images (SVGs created from d3) will render best in Google Chrome!!!!! I hope to figure out how to make the images
more friendly for other browsers.
