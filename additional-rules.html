                            <p>Many players decide to add additional set of rules to make the game more exciting. These may
                            vary depending on the region or platform. Some of
                            them are listed below.
            
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">First Ppuk, Jjok, and Ttadak</span>: If a player performs any of
                               these events on their first turn
                                of the play, they are awarded
                                a certain amount of money that the players agree on.</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Department Store</span>: If a player collects a combination of
                                kwang, yeol, tti, and pi, they are awarded
                                a certain amount of money that the players agree on.</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Last Ttadak, Jjok, Sseul, and Collection of Ppuk</span>: If a player performs any of these events with their
                                last card in their hands, they cannot extort their opponent's pi cards. </li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Last Ppuk</span>: If a player makes a ppuk with their last card in their hands, it is not
                                actually counted. The player may leave the flipped card on the floor.</li>
                            </ul>
                        

                        <h5 class="card-title">Playing With More Than 3 Players</h5>
                        
                            <p>It is theoretically possible to include 4 or more players in the game round, but only
                            three players can directly participate. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The rule for 4 or more players is called
                                        <span class="text-bold text-italicize">kwang-pal-ee (광팔이)</span> because
                                        meaning "kwang seller."</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                            Dealing cards is similar to dealing to 3 players: 4 cards to each
                                            player, 
                                            3 to the floor, 3 to each player and 3 to the floor (See the <a
                                            href="game-setup.html">Game Setup</a> section for more details).
                                            The dealer has to deal the floor cards face down. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The dealer has to be one of the three who must participate in the game. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        All other players take a look at their hand cards. The second player (i.e. player immediately right of the dealer) decides to stay in the game or fold, and the next player decides, and so on in counterclockwise direction.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>As soon as two players decide that they want to continue playing, the remainder
                                    players may be forced to drop out. If the player who come earlier in a turn drops
                                    out, the last players may be forced to play. </li>
                                    <li>The players who are forced drop out are compensated if they hold any of the following cards:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Kwang</li>
                                            <li>Ssanpi, including September yeol</li>
                                            <li>Joker</li>
                                            <li>All three of chungdan, hongdan, or chodan combination</li>
                                            <li>All three of godori cards</li>
                                        </ul>    
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The players who drop out voluntarily are not compensated. The dealer does not have to pay for any compensations.
                                        </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The players should agree on the compensation amount before starting the game. Each card is usually one point worth of amount for each of the cards. 
                                    </p>
