                    <span class="keyword">Go-Stop (고스톱)</span> is a very popular card game in Korea. It is played with special cards that originated from Japan called hanafuda (花札), which translates to “flower cards.” In Korean, hanafuda is known as hwatu.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The game consists of matching cards and earning points. The players make decisions in each turn and set of special events that happen by chance make the game exciting!
                </p>

                <h6 class="card-subtitle">Warning & Recommendation</h6>
                <p>
                    Go-Stop can played as a light form of gambling. Although the game can be played without money, it is considered to be more stimulating and entertaining with the gambling aspect. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The players can decide to map each point earned to a specified amount of money. The more money allocated per point, the more risk the players have to make when they make each decision.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is highly recommended that the game be played within family and friend circles. The gambling aspect—much like with any other common gambling casino games—can instigate distrust with cheating and bring legal troubles. With underaged players, it is recommended that the game is played with adult supervision or that gambling aspect is taken out.
                </p>
