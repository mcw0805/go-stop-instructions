                                    <li>If winning player has exhaused their hand cards, the game is an automatic
                                    "Stop". This player cannot call "Go"
                                    even if the opponent players still have cards in their hands.</li>

                                    <li>Upon winning, calling "Go" is the only way to increase the winnings for the current game, but it is risky in that the other players may steal the victory.</li>

                            <h5 class="card-title">Automatic Winning</h5>
                            <p>The game can also be ended without ever calling "Go" or "Stop." These special
                            circumstances are listed below: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>President
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Immediately after the dealer finishes dealing, if a player has all four of the month cards, that player may decide to call out “president,” which will lead to automatic win with the minimum points. However, the player can choose to remain silent and use three of the cards as bomb after discarding one.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>If the floor cards contain all four month cards before anyone’s first turn of the game, it is an automatic win for the dealer with the minimum points.
                                                </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>3 Ppuk
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If one player makes three ppuks in the game, it is an automatic win for that player with the minimum points.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                
                            </ul>

                            <h5 class="card-title">Tie</h5>
                            <p>It is rare, but it is possible that none of the players will score the minimum points
                            until all players have exhausted their hand cards and the remaining deck is emptied. 
                                This scenario is called <span class="text-italicize text-bold">nagari (나가리)</span>.
                                </p>
                                <p>If there is no winner, another game is played (with the previous winner dealing);
                                however, the next game's winner gets to double their points.  </p>
